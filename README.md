# Customer_Segmentation in R

Most of the times in Marketing, we hear a term as ‘a group of customers who share similar sets of needs and wants.’ Yes, I went back to my textbook for that one. A customer segment could be a cohort of people belonging to the same age group, gender, geographical region, showcasing affinity towards a certain type of product or price range. But when you have a mixed bag of parameters like that, how do you decide which one of those to use to create neat little segments that can be used for targeting a marketing activity? Should people from the North make up one segment, and middle aged people be another, and another one for people who like to shop just on the weekend? But customers are much more complicated than that. A simple geographic or demographic segmentation may not just cut it anymore.

I am going to use k-means algorithms for clustering on a dataset of customers from Kaggle. The dataset mainly covers some demographic attributes of an automobile dealer’s target market of customers. I’ll be using R for this analysis after quite a sabbatical, and might therefore appear Rusty.


### Purpose of the Analysis:
Clustering analysis on data 


### Research Questions:

- What is the overall trend of the dataset, are the segments dominated by males or females.
- How is the trend in terms of Age, is it younger people or elderly people who are dominated in a particular segment. 
- Which segment has low or which one has high spending score.

Based on the analysis, marketing team can decide which type of communication to send to which segment.
